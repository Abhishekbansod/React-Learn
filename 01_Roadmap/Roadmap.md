*****************************************************ReactJS-RoadMap***********************************************
1) Why to learn ReactJS?
-> hype, trend, job and build UI
-> makes easy to manage and build the complex frontend

2) When should we learn ReactJS?
-> After mastering javascript
-> most project do not need react in initial phase

3) Why reactJS was created?
-> Dan --> He is one of the founding members of ReactJS library.
-> Phantom/ghost problem on mobile application facebook where even after the reading the text messages, the unread options were visible
-> To avoid/resolve this issue Dan and his team created a JavaScript library named as 'ReactJS'
-> In the initial pahse, React JS library received so much amount of hate from the developers and other users as well.
-> But later Khan Academy and Unsplash both praised the ReactJS library in one of their article/seminar
-> And now we all know what's the status/demand of ReactJS in the current market

4) React Learning Process:
-> Project based approach(one topic at a time)
-> Learning the concepts using projects/creating projects.
-> Projects such as to do app, calculator app, GITHUB API etc

5) ReactJS is library or framework?
-> React is library of JS

6) Topics to be covered in React JS Course
-> Core of React JS (State or UI, manipulation, JSX)
-> Component reusability
-> reusing of component (props) 
	props -> properties
	e.g. let myObject = {
				name : 'Abhishek', -> props
				email : 'abc@gmail.com'
				unid : 130775
				}
-> How to propagate change (using hooks)
	-->Once you change the variable values, they do not get reflect on UI and to make it reflect on UI we have to use hooks
	-->hooks such useState, useEffect, useMemo

7) Addional addon to React JS
-> Router (React do not have Router) 
	--> Separately we have to import the react-router-dom library to use router in React JS
-> State Management (React do not have state management in the past but now it has state mana...)
	--> Redux, Redux toolkit, Zustand, context API
-> Class based components (Some companies still used this approach bcoz of legacy codes)
-> BASS Apps(Backend as a service)
	--> such as appwrite, firebase, superbase(provides backend as a service)
	--> Social media clone, e-commerce applications etc.

8) After React JS
-> React is not a complete solution in most cases
	--> No SEO
	--> browser render of JS(converts react to JS & then JS to html)
	--> no routing
-> Learn Framworks such NextJS(allows to write frotend & backend at same time), gatsby, remix etc.
